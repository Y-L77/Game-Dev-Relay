## **License and Rights:**
This is an open source repository under the **MIT License**. Contributors will be credited, and anyone is allowed to make a pull request.

## **README:**
This project is a **collaborative coding initiative** for the DAWSS Game Development Club, where multiple contributors can work on the code in ~30-minute intervals. Each contributor works on the project, makes improvements, and either submits their pull request for review or just pushes changes if you're registered as a collaborator. This project will have **regular backups** and **clones** by me in case the repository gets deleted. Every collaborator will be credited and will be displayed on an upcoming **GDev** website for the school. Please read the extended description for more details.

This project will be a **2D game** with **Unity 6**.  
You will need **GitHub** and **GitHub Desktop** or **Git**. Reach out to me for help, or alternatively, watch this tutorial: [Tutorial on GitHub Usage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTIlDb71t2s&t=166s)

## **DESCRIPTION:**
Welcome to **Game Dev Relay**! This **collaborative project** is where complete beginners get to learn **game development** in a way designed to not only be hands-on, but also fun, collaborative, and **100% beginner-friendly**!  
You'll get to learn **coding**, **game design**, **problem-solving**, and **collaboration** through this project, and the best part is, you'll be doing all this while creating something **real**!  
You’ll be part of a **supportive team** that helps each other out. You'll always have someone to ask for help, and you'll be helping others too!
